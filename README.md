## Introduction

You've probably come here because you want to learn AssemblyScript. Awesome! You're in the right place. In this guide we'll cover the basics, and then move on to more advanced topics. In this guide, we'll learn how to manipulate memory, optimize our code, and make JavaScript bindings for AssemblyScript.

## Info

Using NodeJS and NPM is highly recommended, but we provide online StackBlitz workspaces throughout this tutorial. Look for the [**Live Editor âš¡**](https://stackblitz.com/) links to see the code in action.
