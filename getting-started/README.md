AssemblyScript is very easy to install; all you need to do is use NPM on the command line.

```javascript
~ npm install assemblyscript --save-dev
```

Great. We have installed everything we need to start. Initialize the sample project using the following command:

```javascript
~ npm run asinit .
```

Awesome! Now, we have a starter project. In `assembly/index.ts`, there is an exported `add` function. To compile your AssemblyScript project, run this command:

```javascript
~ npm run asbuild
```

Now that we have compiled our program, we need to run it. We'll look at that in the next section. ðŸ˜€
