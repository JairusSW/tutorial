AssemblyScript is very easy to use. All you need to do is install it via NPM.

```javascript
~ npm install assemblyscript --save-dev
```

Great. We have everything we need to start. Now, we need to initialize the sample project.

```javascript
~ npm run asinit .
```

Awesome! Now, we have a full project. In `assembly/index.ts`, there is an exported add function. Now, we need to compile it.

```javascript
~ npm run asbuild
```

Now, that we have compiled our program, we need to run it. We'll look at that in the next section. ðŸ˜€
