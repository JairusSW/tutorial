# Using imports

#### [Live Editor](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-ebvcqs) âš¡

## Overview

This is where it gets really exciting. The imports allows us to call a **JavaScript function from AssemblyScript code**. For example, if we were going to make a console.log function, we would use the imports to let AS access the function. Lets see an example.

## Using the imports

Here we go! Lets make an import!

{% code title="index.js" %}
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const loader = require('@assemblyscript/loader');
// Import the loader
const imports = {
  /* imports go here */
};
const wasmModule = loader.instantiateSync(
  fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/build/optimized.wasm'),
  imports
);
// Instantiate the AS program

wasmModule.exports.test()
// Run the app!

module.exports = wasmModule.exports
```
{% endcode %}

Now, our main AS file.

```javascript
declare function log(message: number): void
// Import the JS log function. (console.log)

export function test(): void {
    log(3.14)
    // Log 3.14 to the console!
}
```

Were all set! Now, we need to set our imports.

```javascript
const imports = {
  index: {
    log: (message) => {
      console.log(message)
      // Log it to the console.
    }
  }
};
```

Almost there! Make sure to rebuild!

```javascript
~ npm run asbuild
```

And lastly, run!

```javascript
~ node index.js
3.14
```

Awesome! Now, you can call JS from AssemblyScript! In a later article, we'll enhance this function to be able to log strings as well!
